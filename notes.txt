Resistor: reduces the amount of current flowing in the circuit
i = V/R
i = ampers
V = volts
R = ohms

LED: long prong (+ cathode); short prong (- anode)
- RED LED needs 220ohm

DIP Switch: 3 independent switches in one component
- When a switch is active it connects the pins
- 5v connected to one pin A of the switch
- input pin connected to pin B of the switch
- 220ohm resistor connected to pin B and GRD. The resistor is needed to help defining the voltage provided to the input pin. Without the resistor, we would get a short circuit.
With the resistor: i = 5v/220ohm = 0.02amps
Without the resistor: i = 5v/~0ohm = short circuit

Photoresistor: more light equals lower resistance; less light equals higher resistance
- Use 5v in one of the photoresistor's pins
- Use analog input for the photoresistor followed by a 220ohm resistor into GRD
